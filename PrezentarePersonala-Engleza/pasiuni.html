  	<h2 class="titlu">What I like to do</h2>
  	<p class="text_centru">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like many children of my age I have a lot of passions. Some of them I discovered when I was young and others I got when I went to high school. Next I will try to introduce you, as short as possible, to the most important of them.</p>
  	
  	<div class="linii">
		<h3 class="titlu_stanga">Guitar</h3>
		<p class="text_stanga">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got this passion in general school and she started after I joined in a small band, made up of few friends. I followed for a while guitar lessons, hoping to become better and better. Seeing I like to play, my parents bought me, around the 7th grade, a classic guitar, the one that I use even today. I do not go to classes anymore because high school is taking me a lot of time, but sometimes I repeat at home or play at different events.</p>

  	<div class="linii"  style="float: right;">
		<h3 class="titlu_dreapta">Informatics</h3>
		<p class="text_dreapta">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my latest passion. Going to Mathematics-Informatics profile and not knowing much about it, I can say that this attracted me relatively quickly. Because I like to know almost everything about technology, I want to learn more about what is behind her. </p>
		<img src="imagini/programming.svg" alt="computer" class="desen" style="padding-left: 20%;padding-top: 100px;">

	<div class="linii">
		<h3 class="titlu_stanga">Video Games</h3>
		<p class="text_stanga">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is my biggest hobby of all and, in the same time, one of the oldest hobbies. Almost everyone how knows me know that I spend a lot of time in front of my computer. Beside the fact that I know this takes me a lot of time, I still do not stop playing games beacause I like this very much and it makes me felling better.</p>

  	<div class="linii"  style="float: right;">
		<h3 class="titlu_dreapta">Astronomy</h3>
		<p class="text_dreapta">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I was young I liked the exact sciences, but among those attracted me the most is astronomy. All the time I asked questions about what is happening outside of the Earth and amazes me the beauty of the Universe, with all his the planets, stars, galaxies and unexplainable phenomena.</p>

  	<div class="linii">
		<h3 class="titlu_stanga">Puzzles</h3>
		<p class="text_stanga">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is one the passion that I think I will have it my entire life. From a younger age I liked to solve puzzles, no matter how difficult they were. I am currently trying to solve a puzzle of 3000 pieces, but I still have a lot of work to do until I finish it.</p>

  	<div class="linii"  style="float: right;">
		<h3 class="titlu_dreapta">The Piano</h3>
		<p class="text_dreapta">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was a old passion of mine, which unfortunately I am not practicing anymore from 2nd grade. I took lessons at the Children's Club and at the Music School in the city, but I think because of the age I gave up, without thinking about consequences, which I regret now. </p>

  	<div class="linii">
		<h3 class="titlu_stanga">Painting</h3>
		<p class="text_stanga">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is more a hobby than a passion. Although I took lessons when I was little, now I am no longer used to drawing. Anyway, when needed, I always enjoy drawing something, whether he's just in the pencil or in color.</p>

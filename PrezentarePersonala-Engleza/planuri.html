  	<h2 class="titlu">What will I do in the future?</h2>
  	
  	<p class="text_centru">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A very hard question.</strong> If you asked me that a few years ago, maybe before I go to the high school, or even earlier, I would have known what I wanted to do next: a high school student who always tries to be the best, something he still works on.<br><br></p>
  	<p class="text_centru">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that question is far more difficult, she puts me more on thoughts than before. Going to high school, I realized that if I want to get someone I need to work first and that anything you propose is not impossible. I came to the Mathematics-Informatics profile from the desire to learn a lot and to focus on what I like: informatics and exact sciences. For a few years I've been thinking about going to college abroad, in England for example, after which I will return in the country. However, as the days pass, my plans are changing, not knowing what faculty or job I would like to follow. Mostly, I want to continue with informatics or something close to it. I would like, as in the future, to be an astronaut or a programmer engineer, or even a man recognized worldwide for his work, but I do not know what chances I would have, taking into account that it will be very difficult and will intervene, along the way, many other temptations.<br><br></p>
  	<p class="text_centru">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I hope to succeed in everything I want. I want to set up a beautiful family and to keep my close friends all my life. I will try to have a well-paid job and to work where I like.<br><br></p>
  	<p class="text_centru">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end, I hope I can successfully lead all my wishes, no matter how complicated they are, and for the rest to enjoy any moment of my life.</p>
